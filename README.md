This is an implementation of two research articles on how to consistently orient normals in points clouds.
The implemented papers are:
* _Surface Reconstruction from Unorganized Points_, Hoppe et al., 1992. [Conference website](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/133994.134011). Available for download [here](http://hhoppe.com/recon.pdf).
* _Consistent Propagation of Normal Orientations in Point Clouds_, König and Gumhold, 2009. Available for download [here](http://www.inf.tu-dresden.de/content/institutes/smt/cg/publications/paper/normal_propagation.pdf).
